## Have more advanced use case?

Does your project need Data Orchestration, third party integrations, hosting or other e-commerce related functionalities? Check out [Vue Storefront](https://vuestorefront.io/) and the [open source Nuxt template using agnostic sdk & middleware](https://github.com/vuestorefront/storefront-nuxt3-boilerplate)

## Integrations

If you wish to add an integration with 3rd Party service like Content Management System, Search Engine, or Payment Provider, you can do so by using the regular Nuxt module approach.

Create a new folder in the `modules` directory named as your integration (i.e `storyblok`) and inside of it, and `index.ts` file.
If your integration already has a Nuxt module existing, you can import it as follows:
```ts
//modules/storyblok/index.ts

export default defineNuxtModule({
  async setup() {
    await installModule('@storyblok/nuxt')
  }
})
```

In this file, you can also add integration specific code like components, composables, pages, and more!

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
yarn preview
```
