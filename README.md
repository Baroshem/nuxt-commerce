## Integrations

If you wish to add an integration with 3rd Party service like Content Management System, Search Engine, or Payment Provider, you can do so by using the regular Nuxt module approach.

Create a new folder in the `modules` directory named as your integration (i.e `storyblok`) and inside of it, and `index.ts` file.

<details>
<summary>Why this approach?</summary>

*Normally, you could just install the modules and plugins directly inside the global `nuxt.config.ts` but as your application grows, it could become much harder to maintain the project. By following the `modules` approach defined by Nuxt you can easily extract domain code into separate module that wraps components, composables, types, and overall integration configuration*
</details>

### Adding a new integration

If your integration already has a Nuxt module existing, you can import it like shown below. In this file, you can also add integration specific code like components, composables, pages, and enable auto import for them.

```ts
// modules/storyblok/index.ts

export default defineNuxtModule({
  meta: {
    name: "storyblok",
  },
  async setup() {
    const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url);
    addImportsDir(resolve("composables"));  // enable auto import for components/composables/types

    await installModule('@storyblok/nuxt', {
      apiKey: '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
      // more configuration options
    })
  }
})
```

In case of funcionality that does not have a Nuxt module yet, instead of `installModule` function, you would need to write a custom plugin youself.

## E-Commerce Backend

By default, Nuxt Commerce works with Shopify as the E-Commerce Backend but you can different backends as well like Medusa, BigCommerce, Magento, or WooCommerce.

To do so, you would need to create a custom integration by following thse steps:

1. Create a new folder in `modules` directory
2. In this folder, create a new `index.ts` file where the e-commerce backend code will be.
3. In this file, write integration code by using following example:

```ts
// modules/medusa/index.ts

export default defineNuxtModule({
  meta: {
    name: "medusa",
  },
  async setup() {
    const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url);
    addImportsDir(resolve("composables"));  // enable auto import for components/composables/types

    await installModule('nuxt-medusa', {
      baseUrl: '<YOUR_BASE_URL>'
      // more configuration options
    })
  }
})
```

4. Create composable that will contain the logic to handle complex e-commerce logic that is specific for this e-commerce backend like `useCart`, `useAuth`, etc
5. Create types, GQL queries, components and utils that are e-commerce specific.
6. Remove `shopify` folder from your project
7. Adjust the application to the new types and logic
8. Have fun and enjoy your new e-commerce app!

After creating a custom integration module, please let us know so that we could add it to our documentation as a source of knowledge for others to use it in their project :)
